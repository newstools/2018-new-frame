On 30 March 2018, six months ago, Palestinians launched the Great March of Return in the Gaza Strip. The protests called for the right of return of Palestinian refugees, and the end of the siege which has throttled the Gaza Strip for more than a decade. Mohammed Zaanoun, a photographer from Gaza, was there.  Zaanoun was injured during the protest, when shrapnel penetrated his hands. He says that "The occupying forces deliberately target journalists. There is always a danger, so every Friday I feel that I will not go home".  But, he adds, "With my photos, I hope that the world will see the truth about is happening in Gaza".
